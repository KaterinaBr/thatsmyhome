title:  "Mastiha"

#### Greek: Μαστίχα
#### Translation: Mastic (plant resin)

Mastika is a liqueur seasoned with mastic, a resin with a slightly pine or cedar-like flavor gathered from the mastic tree, a small evergreen tree native to the Mediterranean region.  


In Greece, mastika (Greek: μαστίχα) is a strong spirit similar to ouzo or tsikoudia. It is served cold or at room temperature but usually with ice. Both turn white (louche) when poured over ice or mixed with water, forming small crystals when frozen. They are served with various mezedes — appetizers such as octopus, salad, sardines, calamari, fried zucchini, and clams.
